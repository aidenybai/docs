Million is a lightweight (`<1kb`) Virtual DOM. It's [_**really fast**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks) and makes it easy to create user interfaces.

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gim`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I bother switching?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy as [React](https://reactjs.org), but with faster performance and smaller bundle size for the end user. By computing the user interface beforehand with a compiler, Million reduces the overhead of traditional Virtual DOM.

> Okay cool... but why should I use Million if I can just use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) if I need something a bit more lightweight?

While alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes by efficient code design, Million takes it a step further by **leveraging compilation** to make a quantum leap in improving bundle size **and** render speed.

Think of it as if [React](https://preactjs.com/)'s API and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)'s compiler had a baby. [A baby with _**super speed! ðŸ‘¶**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks)

## Our First Application

Open this [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react-compat) or clone this [repo](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react-compat) to get started.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react-compat)

Navigate to `script.jsx` and you should see this:

```jsx filename="script.jsx"
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom';

function Counter({ init }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(init);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Counter: {value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('#app'));

root.render(<Counter init={0} />);
```

<ReactCounter init={0} />

Open the StackBlitz preview (should be at `XXXXXXXXXXX-local.webcontainer.io`), if you see content and you're able to interact with it, you're ready to rumble!

Within the `script.jsx` file, you can write any React code with some [limitations](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react-compat#limitations). If you are unfamiliar with React, you can learn more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Now that you're all set up to play around, let's look at a couple practical examples as a foundation for teaching you the basics of Million. By the end of this exercise, you should be more than equipped to start building stuff on your own.

Happy Coding!

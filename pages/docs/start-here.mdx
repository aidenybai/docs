Open this [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react-compat) or clone this [repo](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react-compat) to get started.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react-compat)

Navigate to `script.jsx` and you should see this:

```jsx filename="script.jsx" {1, 19-24}
import { compat } from 'million/react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom';

function Counter({ init }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(init);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Counter: {value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(value - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('#app'));

// Anything that references a component at the root level MUST be wrapped
// within the compat() function.
compat(() => {
  // Generally, if there is something erroring, shove rendering logic inside here
  root.render(<Counter init={0} />);
});
```

<ReactCounter init={0} />

Open the StackBlitz preview (should be at `XXXXXXXXXXX-local.webcontainer.io`), if you see content and you're able to interact with it, you're ready to rumble!

Within the `script.jsx` file, you can write any React code with some [limitations](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react-compat#limitations). If you are unfamiliar with React, you can learn more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

There is one caveat though: the `compat()` function. All component instantiations must be wrapped within the `compat()` function.

```jsx
// ✅ Good
compat(() => {
  root.render(<MyComponent />);
});

// ❌ Error
root.render(<MyComponent />);
```

Now that you're all set up to play around, let's look at a couple practical examples as a foundation for teaching you the basics of Million. By the end of this exercise, you should be more than equipped to start building stuff on your own.

Happy Coding!

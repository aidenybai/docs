# Getting Started

## Installation

Inside your project directory, run the following command:

```sh
npm install million
```

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add million
```

## Quick Start

For a normal JavaScript project, you'll first need to import Million's basic functions:

```js
import { m, createElement, patch } from 'million';
```

<Callout>
  If you want to use a templating language like JSX,{' '}

  with Million
</Callout>

Then, you can start building your app (e.g. Counter app):

```js
import { m, createElement, patch } from 'million';

const view = (seconds) => m('p', undefined, [`Time elapsed: ${seconds}`]);

const el = createElement(view(0));

let seconds = 0;

setInterval(() => {
  patch(el, view(seconds));
  seconds++;
}, 1000);

document.body.appendChild(el);
```

<Counter />

`patch()` function has a standard interface that is used in many Virtual DOM libraries. First argument is a DOM node that will be used as the live DOM reference, and the second one is a Virtual DOM to render.

`createElement()` function converts a "Virtual DOM" node into a real DOM node.

`m()` function will instantiate a "Virtual DOM" node for an element.

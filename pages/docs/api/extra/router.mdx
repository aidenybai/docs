# `router()`

**Syntax:** `router(routes)`\
**Example:** `router()`

There are two uses for the `router()` function:

### 1. Turning a Multi Page Application (MPA) into a Single Page Application (SPA)

The `router()` function initiates SPA like routing functionality for an MPA. This removes the necessity for page navigations and makes the application more responsive, while keeping multiple HTML files. Imagine [Turbo Drive](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/reference/drive), but powered by Million, and significantly more simpler.

```js
import { router } from 'million/router';

router();
```

### 2. Creating client side routes for a SPA

`router` also accepts a `routes` parameter, which skips fetching if you have predefined virtual nodes. For example:

```js
import { _, m } from 'million';
import { router } from 'million/router';

router({
  '/': m('div', _, ['You are at /', m('a', { href: '/foo' }, ['Go to /foo'])]),
  '/foo': m('div', _, ['You are at /foo', m('a', { href: '/' }, ['Go to /'])]),
});
```

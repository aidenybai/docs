# `router()`

**Syntax:** `router(routes)`\
**Example:** `router()`

The `router` function initiates Single Page Application (SPA) like routing functionality. This removes the necessity for page navigations and makes the application more responsive. Imagine [Turbo Drive](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/reference/drive), but powered by Million.

It accepts a `routes` parameter, which skips fetching if you have predefined content. For example:

```js
{ '/index': 'Hello World!' }
```

```js
import { router } from 'million/router';

router();
```

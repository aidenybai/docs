# Compiler

Million.js is intended to be the Virtual DOM runtime for your application. It's primarily designed to be augmented by a compiler which can produce optimizations and code generation for Million.js. However, Million.js doesn't provide a compiler by default, as static analysis and code generation are difficult to pull off well without knowledge of the library (state, components, etc.).

However, Million.js does provide example implementations for virtual node `h` functions to raw objects with [`vite-plugin-million`](https://github.com/aidenybai/vite-plugin-million).

If you are considering writing a compiler for your Million.js library, consider taking a look at the implemenation of [`vite-plugin-million`](https://github.com/aidenybai/vite-plugin-million). Additionally, you should look into [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) and [ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types), both great options for JavaScript AST traversal for static analysis.
